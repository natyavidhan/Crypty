# Crypty 

## What Is Crypty? 
Crypty is a **Basic Desktop application** for **Encrypting and Decrypting** text with **Password protection**. Currently, Crypty is in BETA stage, So feel free to suggest new features. Crypty is open source so you can look into the code or maybe make some changes to it.

## How It Is Safe?
Crypty is made with [Cryptocode](https://pypi.org/project/cryptocode/), And It is a Python library used to encrypt and decrypt strings in the simplest possible way, while also being incredibly secure.

## How to use Crypty?
After Downloading the files, you can find a Executable file, Open it. You can see a Window popup. Now, put the text you want to Encrypt and a password to secure it (Note: If you lost your password, you cannot decrypt your text). and press Encrypt. (Note: Before Encrypting, Clear ANY TYPE OF TEXT in the output area or else it will add the encrypted text after it) You have encrypted your text! Now, for decrypting, do the same, but instead of normal text, put the encrypted text on the encryted text bar. and the password on the password bar under the decypt section. Press decrypt (Note: Before Decrypting, Clear ANY TYPE OF TEXT in the output area or else it will add the decrypted text after it). You text is Decrypted! You have no need to install python for **USING CRYPTY**. But if you want to make changes in the code, you need to install some [Modules](https://github.com/studiousgamer/Crypty/blob/main/README.md#modules-used-in-making-of-crypty).

## Modules used in making of Crypty
- [Cryptocode](https://pypi.org/project/cryptocode/)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
