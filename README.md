# Crypty 

## What Is Crypty? 
Crypty is a **Basic Desktop application** for **Encrypting and Decrypting** text with **Password protection**. Currently, Crypty is in BETA stage, So feel free to suggest new features. Crypty is open source so you can look into the code or maybe make some changes to it.

## How It Is Safe?
Crypty is made with [Cryptocode](https://pypi.org/project/cryptocode/), And It is a Python library used to encrypt and decrypt strings in the simplest possible way, while also being incredibly secure.

## How to use Crypty?
If you only want to use Crypty, you have to download it from [here](https://mega.nz/file/q0cQwTiR#7Fjsi4CWuvmgh6UIMT3JRNiRibGqf_DpTKQ31srMyI4). After downloading, Open it. A Window will popup. Click on Encrypt for encrypting. Now, put the text you want to Encrypt and a password to secure it (Note: If you lose your password, you cannot decrypt your text). and press Encrypt. You have encrypted your text! You can see it in the output text bar. Now, for decrypting, close the encrypt window and click on decrypt. Now, put the encrypted text on the encryted text bar. and the password on the password bar. Press decrypt. You text is Decrypted! You can see it in the output text bar. You have no need to install python for **USING CRYPTY**. But if you want to make changes in the code, you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and some [Modules](https://github.com/studiousgamer/Crypty/blob/main/README.md#modules-used-in-making-of-crypty).

## Modules used in making of Crypty
- [Cryptocode](https://pypi.org/project/cryptocode/)
